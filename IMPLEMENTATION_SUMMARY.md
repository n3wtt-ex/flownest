# User Approval System Implementation Summary

This document provides a summary of all files created and modified to implement the user approval system.

## Database Migrations

### Modified Existing Migrations

1. **db/migrations/007_fix_organization_creation_triggers.sql**
   - Updated `create_default_organization_for_user` function to set new users as inactive (`is_active = false`) with pending approval status
   - Updated `get_current_user_organization_id` function to check both `is_active` and `approval_status`

2. **db/migrations/013_add_approve_user_function.sql**
   - Verified that `approve_user` and `reject_user` functions correctly handle both approval status and active status

### New Migrations

3. **db/migrations/015_add_user_approval_check_function.sql**
   - Created `is_user_approved_and_active` function to check if a user is approved and active
   - Created `get_user_approval_status_message` function to return appropriate messages based on user approval status

## Frontend Files

### Modified Files

4. **src/hooks/useAuth.ts**
   - Added approval status checking functionality
   - Added `approvalStatus` state to track user's approval status
   - Added `checkUserApprovalStatus` function to call the RPC function
   - Updated `signIn` function to check approval status after successful login
   - Added `useEffect` to check approval status on auth state changes
   - Added error handling for when the RPC function doesn't exist yet

5. **src/App.tsx**
   - Added logic to redirect users with non-approved status to the auth error page
   - Checks `approvalStatus` and redirects appropriately
   - Only redirects if we have a valid approval status that is not 'approved'

6. **src/components/Auth/LoginRegister.tsx**
   - Added useEffect to check approval status and redirect appropriately
   - Enhanced form handling to work with approval status checking
   - Only redirects if we have a valid approval status that is not 'approved'

7. **src/pages/AuthError.tsx**
   - Enhanced the component to display appropriate icons and messages based on the approval status
   - Added icons for different statuses (pending, rejected, etc.)
   - Added dynamic titles based on the message content

### New Files

8. **USER_APPROVAL_IMPLEMENTATION.md**
   - Detailed documentation of the user approval system implementation
   - Includes database changes, frontend changes, and how the system works

9. **apply_user_approval_migrations.sql**
   - Single script containing all database changes for easy manual application
   - Can be run directly in the Supabase SQL editor

10. **quick_fix_migrations.sql**
    - Quick fix script to resolve immediate issues with existing accounts
    - Creates a simplified version of the approval status function
    - Updates organization creation and lookup functions

11. **IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md**
    - This file, providing an overview of all changes made

12. **README.md**
    - Updated to include information about the user approval system
    - Added section explaining how the system works and references to detailed documentation

## How to Apply Changes

### Option 1: Using Supabase CLI (if configured correctly)
```bash
cd c:\project\flownest
supabase db push
```

### Option 2: Manual Application
1. Run the SQL script in `quick_fix_migrations.sql` in the Supabase SQL editor to resolve immediate issues
2. Run the SQL script in `apply_user_approval_migrations.sql` in the Supabase SQL editor for complete functionality
3. Deploy the updated frontend code

## Testing the Implementation

1. Register a new user account
2. Verify that the user appears in the admin panel with "Pending" status and is inactive
3. Try to log in as the pending user - you should be redirected to the AuthError page with the pending message
4. As an admin, approve the user - they should now be able to log in
5. As an admin, reject a different user - they should not be able to log in and should see the rejection message

## Key Features Implemented

1. New users are automatically set to "pending approval" status and inactive
2. Pending users cannot access the site
3. Admins can approve or reject users through the admin panel
4. Approved users become active and can access the site
5. Rejected users remain inactive and cannot access the site
6. Rejected users see a specific message when trying to log in
7. All changes are properly documented for future maintenance
8. Existing users are not affected by the changes (quick fix implemented)
